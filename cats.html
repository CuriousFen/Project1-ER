            How Cats Arrive At Pawffee
        </h1>
        <p>
            At some cat cafés around the world, the cats may be purchased as kittens and spend their whole life 
            at the café. The Pawffee Shop works differently. Pawffee is partnered with Safe Haven Pet Sanctuary, 
            an animal sanctuary located in Greenbay, WI. Cats that arrive at Safe Haven come from all walks of life. 

            Sometimes owners are unable to care for their cats anymore due to various life changes. But Safe Haven 
            also has a special focus: caring for cats that are victims of abuse, neglect, or who have disabilities. 
            This means that some cats might be extra shy, be blind, have missing limbs, or need special diets. At 
            many shelters, these cats might be seen as unadoptable. But Safe Haven is a no-kill sanctuary that gives 
            these “less adoptable” cats a second chance.

            Through their mutually beneficial partnership, many cats that arrive at Safe Haven are brought to Pawffee 
            to live, play, and meet visitors until they find their next forever home.
