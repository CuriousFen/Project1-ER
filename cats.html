                How Cats Arrive At Pawffee
            </h2>
            <p>
                At some cat cafés around the world, the cats may be purchased as kittens and spend their whole life 
                at the café. The Pawffee Shop works differently. Pawffee is partnered with Safe Haven Pet Sanctuary, 
                an animal sanctuary located in Greenbay, WI. Cats that arrive at Safe Haven come from all walks of life. 
                <br><br>
                Sometimes owners are unable to care for their cats anymore due to various life changes. But Safe Haven 
                also has a special focus: caring for cats that are victims of abuse, neglect, or who have disabilities. 
                This means that some cats might be extra shy, be blind, have missing limbs, or need special diets. At 
                many shelters, these cats might be seen as unadoptable. But Safe Haven is a no-kill sanctuary that gives 
                these “less adoptable” cats a second chance.
                <br><br>
                Through their mutually beneficial partnership, many cats that arrive at Safe Haven are brought to Pawffee 
                to live, play, and meet visitors until they find their next forever home.

            <h2>
                Helping Cats Socialize
            </h2>
            <p>
                There’s a stereotype that cats like to be all by themselves, don’t like people, and only sleep. Well, they 
                do sleep a lot. But contrary to popular belief, cats love to play with other cats and people! The pet cats 
                of today descend from the african wild cat, which is not just predator but also prey to some bigger carnivores. 
                Whereas dogs are descended from wolves, which are at the top of the food chain. Plus, cats are usually quite 
                a bit smaller than most dogs. So if a cat isn’t as friendly towards you as a dog, don’t feel too bad. 
                <br><br>
                But living at Pawffee gives the cats plenty of chances to meet all sorts of nice people every day. With each 
                nice interaction, a shy cat gets to learn “Oh, new people can be nice”. This builds their confidence so they 
                can spend more time feeling relaxed, focus on play, and would-be adopters can see their personality shine.
                <br><br>
                Stray cats are known to form small groups called cat colonies. They enjoy the companionship, extra safety, 
                and playmates. Sometimes when an owner who already has a cat brings home a new one, it doesn’t go over very 
                well because of territory issues and it’s possible that a cat might not remember seeing another cat in it’s 
                entire life. The open concept and cage-free environment at Pawffee allows cats to interact with each other. 
                They can play, cuddle, or sneak off to plenty of hides when they need a little alone time. This not only 
                provides enrichment, but grows their cat to cat socialization skills for any new home where they may be living 
                with another cat.
