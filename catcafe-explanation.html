        <h2>About Cat Cafés</h2>
        <p>
            A cat café is a relaxing space where visitors can enjoy coffee or tea while
            spending time with friendly cats. These cafés provide a calm environment that helps
            people unwind and brings joy through the company of cats.
        </p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>
            Guests can sit in a warm, quiet area filled with cats that roam freely.
            Many cat cafés feature cozy seating, gentle music, and light refreshments.
            Visitors are welcome to read, study, or simply relax while the cats
            nap beside them or play nearby.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond offering relaxation, cat cafés create a unique bond between people and animals.
            Visitors often find comfort in the gentle presence of cats, while the cats enjoy social interaction
            and mental stimulation from human company. The calm atmosphere encourages mindfulness,
            making each visit not just a leisure experience, but also a small moment of emotional healing.

        <h2>Atmosphere and Design</h2>
        <p>
            Every cat café is thoughtfully designed to create a sense of warmth and calm.
            Soft lighting, gentle music, and natural materials such as wood and plants help
            build a soothing environment that both cats and visitors enjoy.
            Comfortable seating allows guests to read, chat, or simply unwind while cats wander freely,
            creating an inviting home-like feeling that encourages slow, mindful moments.

        <h2>Cat Welfare and Adoption</h2>
        <p>
            Many cat cafés partner with local shelters to give cats a safe and loving environment
            while they wait for their forever homes. Each adoption-friendly café helps raise awareness
            about animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.
            By visiting, guests not only enjoy a peaceful experience but also contribute to a meaningful cause —
            giving every cat a chance for love and care.
