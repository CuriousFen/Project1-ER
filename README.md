Reflection:
We officially started working one week before the deadline. First, we determined the theme of animal rescue. Then we found the website of the cat café. After that, we decided to base our own website on this website. I was assigned to create the part introducing the cat café. I officially started my part two days before the deadline. On the last day, which was Sunday, we used it to determine the format of the website and check for any bugs.
The main tool I relied on was Google. This was because some of the code was unfamiliar to me and also due to my limited understanding, my own knowledge was unable to achieve the desired effect. Therefore, I needed to search for cases and codes online constantly.
Bugs:
No major issues, but some image alignment needed manual adjustment when resizing the window.
