Reflection:
We officially started working one week before the deadline. First, we determined the theme of animal rescue. Then we found the website of the cat café. After that, we decided to base our own website on this website. I was assigned to create the part introducing the cat café. I officially started my part two days before the deadline. On the last day, which was Sunday, we used it to determine the format of the website and check for any bugs.
The main tool I relied on was Google. This was because some of the code was unfamiliar to me and also due to my limited understanding, my own knowledge was unable to achieve the desired effect. Therefore, I needed to search for cases and codes online constantly.
Bugs:
No major issues, but some image alignment needed manual adjustment when resizing the window.

Reflection:
My teammates and I worked together to create a website for Pawffee Shop, a cat café that promotes cat adoption and animal care. The process was both exciting and challenging, allowing me to apply what I’ve learned in class while gaining new experience through real teamwork.
During development, I was mainly responsible for the Support Page design and styling. The biggest challenge for me was learning how to create my own branch on GitHub and make updates without affecting the team’s main code. At first, I wasn’t familiar with Git commands and often got confused by merge conflicts and version syncing issues. However, with my teammates’ guidance and support, I gradually learned how to use Git properly, merge branches safely, and work collaboratively in a shared environment.
This project helped me understand the true importance of teamwork. Every discussion, edit, and small fix we worked on together made the final result better. My teammates’ patience and encouragement gave me confidence and motivation to keep improving my technical skills and become a more responsible and cooperative developer in the future.
Bugs: No major issues

Reflection: 
I had been absent the day the project was officially assigned and us put into groups. I didn't realize until 10/26, which meant there was only a week left. I immediately reached out to group mates, created a GitHub repo for the project while I waited, and then made a Discord group chat for us to coordinate in once everyone replied. I made a list of various types of places around that "do good", then presenting it to the group, and we all agreed that an animal shelter/sanctuary would be great. Because who doesn't love animals? That very day I had gone to The Pawffee Shop in Appleton, and my groupmmates agreed to use it as the organization we'd want to promote. I then thought about what kind of questions people might have about Pawffee if they're completely unfamiliar, and I recalled past conversations with people. That gave us our pages.
People still seemed a little unsure how to approach beginning though. And we didn't have much time to draw up tons of designs. In art, they say a blank page is the scariest thing. So I made a very bare skeleton for everyone to start working on. I made the rest of the needed page files, added a placeholder image to the image folder to keep that functional, and then added a basic header, footer, and background to each page with simple styling in the css file. 
I chose to do the index.html and cats.html page, and then let Songlin and Zhihan choose which of the remaining 2 they wanted to do. We made sure to communicate about progress, any troubles, and I made several little git reference posts in our Discord chat. Songlin her the first to really finish up her styling in the css file for her page, and it turned out really cute. So Zhihan and I integrated that styling into our own pages. Though at the end, we did make some edits together here and there to make everything feel like it belonged.
I have found that I really like making websites, and the information sticks better in my head than other types of code (I'm more of an artistic person than anaylitical..). I've also taken some classes before for building websites. So although I'm still a beginner, it was like shaking off the rust and getting more practice in. But using git... this was amazing practice for it. Slowly, I didn't need the reference post I made anymore. And when Zhihan had some trouble, it allowed me to get proper access to his branch to help him out a bit. My only worry with git is maybe I did too many commits? lol. 
Using the GitHub reviewing was also extremely useful. It took a bit to get used to the UI. But it was extremely useful when I spotted was an issue with one person's pull request, and we were able to fix it so that the pull request and merge could go through.
Overall. The secret was communication. Constant messaging in Discord, keeping people up to date, doing proper commits with descriptions, reviewing pull requests before merging, and keeping to our branches, but communicating any changes to shared files/sections.
Bugs:
No major issues. Perhaps some allignment on the homepage if the window gets too small. Still learning how to address that more gracefully.
