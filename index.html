                <p>The Pawffee Shop is a full service coffee bar with a room that serves as a cat sanctuary! It's 
                    the perfect stop for when you need that caffiene pick-me-up, a snack, and want to relax with 
                    some feline friends. Purchase your drink or snack in the main cafe, then head on next door 
                    to sit down among the cats.</p>
                
                <p>All cats are adoptable, you could meet your new best furry family member today. And if you can't
                    adopt, the cats always enjoy visitors. Especially if you wave around some fun string or wands!
